# Project Settings
Project Managers can configure which features of project manager they want to have visible and utilize on their individual projects.  The Project Settings can be accessed from the right-hand popout bar.

## Project Logic

Project Managers can choose the following behaviors for their project:

* Automatic calculation of Project RAG Status - If this is enabled and a Project RAG Tolerance Matrix is selected, the Project RAG Status field in the project details becomes read only and the value is automatically determined based on the selected matrix. This allows the Project Manager to give custom weightings to individual project RAG tolerances to better manage their project overall.
* Automatic recording of daily project costs - If this is enabled, the system will total up the project costs at the end of every day and record it as an entry against the project's cost history. These values can be visualized on a line graph on the costs tab of a project and they can also be edited if the user has the appropriate permissions in the project to do so.

## Reports

Project Managers can action pre built reports against their project

Currently available reports are:

* Project Summary

### Configuring Project Tabs

* All of the available features of a Project are represented with a title and a toggle

* By default, all project tabs are enabled
* Toggle a project tab off to make it invisible to **All** project members for that given project
* Toggle a project tab on to make it visible again to **All** project members for that given project

## Project Role Permissions

Manage what permissions each project member has to every aspect of a project through the project role they have been assigned. 

It is possible to allocate the following permissions to each aspect of a project

* View
* Add
* Edit
* Remove

In addition to the standard permissions on project features, additional more granular permissions can be set for tasks linked to a project:

* Edit
* Edit Task Dates
* Edit Task Ownership
* Edit Task relationships

By default, all project roles will have full access and rights to all project aspects. The Project Manager can then through **Project Settings** in the side panel of a given project, add permissions to one or all project roles for their given project.

* Select the role to apply the permissions too
* Select the permissions required for the role by selecting each tick box next to the required feature and permission.

* Apply permissions to **All** project features, both vertically and horizontally by clicking the icon of the project feature and or the specific permission type

Once finished, click **Update** to apply

* Project Managers can edit and remove permissions on a project by project basis.

\* If Project Permissions have been set in a project template, they will be immediately applied to any project raised against the project template, and only the project manager will have the rights to edit or remove them once applied.

## Managing Project Features in Project Templates

As well as configuring the project settings per project, it is also possible to predefine these in your **Project Templates** so these will be automatically inherited once a project is raised from a given project template.

* This will remove the need to configure these settings on a project by project basis
* Project Managers for projects raised from templates can still configure project settings once the project has been raised from the project template

## Time Recording
The Time Recording tab within project settings is available to the project manager if Hornbill Timesheet Manager is installed.

Project Managers can view and review recorded time against their project by:

* Category
* Sub-Category
* By Project Member
* In List view

### Project Time

The Project Time tab gives a high level summary of all time recorded against the project:

* Total Project Time.
* Details of the last timesheet value recorded against the project.
* A chart showing total project time per project stakeholder.
* Options to customize the chart appearance based on chart type and theme.

### Settings

The Settings tab allows the project manager to set the default timesheet category and sub category values for the various project areas:

* The project in general
