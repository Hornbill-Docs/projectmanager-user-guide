# Project Portfolio
Introduction The Project Portfolio provides visibility, access and supporting data relating to projects where you are either a stakeholder, or you have been assigned the **Project Portfolio Manager** role. The views include a list of Projects with high level details and progress, overviews of current portfolio tasks and risks as well as groupings based on Tags or Favorite flags . Projects where you are not the Project Manager, a Stakeholder or if you do not have the project portfolio manager role, will not be available to you from this view. Raise new projects by using the red **+** icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
