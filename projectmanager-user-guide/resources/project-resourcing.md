# Project Resourcing
Project Resourcing allows those users that are allocated the **Project Portfolio Manager** role to view the workloads and define the capacity of both individual stakeholders and project teams.

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders tab displays a list of Project Manager users and provides a choice of three views for the selected stakeholder. The first and default view is called the '2 Week Workload' view and displays project tasks assigned to the selected stakeholder in the form of a gantt chart. The second view is of Project Tasks assigned to the selected stakeholder, and the third view is of Projects the stakeholder is a member of.

### 2 Week Workload View

In this view, active project tasks that are assigned to the selected stakeholder are visualized in a gantt chart. Clicking on a task will open its details in a popup window. The tasks are color coded to the project they are part of. A legend of all projects is available at the bottom of the chart. To see more information about a task without opening it, simply hover the mouse over it.  
  
#### Capacity

If a capacity record is defined for the selected stakeholder, capacity related information will be available. If no record is defined, you will see a gray warehouse icon. If a capacity record is defined, you can view capacity information in one of 2 views. The first and default view represents the information as symbols (green ticks or red crosses). This is simply to indicate if the selected stakeholder is within capacity or over capacity for the selected period. The first icon represents the first week of the 2 displayed in the gantt chart, and the second icon represents the second week. So for example, 2 green ticks represents being within capacity for both weeks in the period. Hovering over each icon will give you the capacity percentage as a number. If you want to see the capacity percentages themselves, hit the toggle switch on the main toolbar called 'Show Capacity %'.  
  
Clicking on either the capacity icons or the capacity numbers for the selected stakeholder will open a popup window. Here you will find more detailed information on capacity, broken down by each weekly period.

## Capacity

The Capacity tab allows the creation and modification of capacity records for both individual stakeholders and project teams. All capacity records can be modified at any time and there is an automatic audit trail to capture any changes that are made. When creating capacity records, you are required to provide the number of hours worked per week and the capacity percentage for each stakeholder. For each project team, these figures are calculated automatically. Creating these capacity records allows the system to calculate workload percentages based on the estimated time against each project task.
